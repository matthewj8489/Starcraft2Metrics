Functions:
1) Build Order Deviation (BOD)
  Determines the average deviation of the time when a unit and building was created by a player in a replay with the time when those units and buildings were made by a benchmark replay. This function will allow a user to see how much deviation occurred between their executed build in any given replay and the benchmark of that same replay.
