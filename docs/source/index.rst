Welcome to Starcraft2Metrics's documentation!
=============================================

Starcraft2Metrics offers metrics calculated from replay files using the **sc2reader** parser.

The end goal of Starcraft2Metrics is to offer the user a visualization of the trend of 
each metric that is calculated in order for the user to see if there has been improvement 
over a period of time. This information can be used to locate weak points in a player's
skill and improve that area.
